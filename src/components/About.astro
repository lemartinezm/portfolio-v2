  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm Luis, a web developer with good attention to detail and passion for
    creating exceptional online experiences. My journey in the development world
    started with a research internship where I performed atmospheric data
    analysis using Python.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from personal websites to
    complex web applications, collaborating with multidisciplinary teams in
    dynamic and fast-paced work environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have an exciting project in mind or just want to talk about web
    development, I'd be happy to listen! Collaboration is key for me, and I
    believe ideas are magnified when shared.
  </p>
  <p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio and for considering my work!</p>
